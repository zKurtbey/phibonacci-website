          Why Would You Take Fibonacci As A Path To Learn, Practice Or Do
          Whatever You Want?
        </h2>

        <div className="desc">
          <p>
            Fibonacci is a sequence of nature. The Golden Ratio, 1.618 comes
            from Fibonacci. You can see the Golden Spiral in flowers' petals,
            pinecones, shell spirals and galaxies.
          </p>

          <p>
            1.618 is a number of universality. Some randomization functions in
            computers use this number. Flowers' petals are arranged with this
            number to make the flower be the as productive as possible for
            photosynthesis.

          Fibonacci retracements
        </h3>

        <div className="desc">
          <p>Fibonacci retracements are:</p>

          <ul
            style={{
              marginTop: 0,
            }}
          >
            <li>0.236</li>
            <li>0.382</li>
            <li>0.5</li>
            <li>0.618</li>
            <li>0.786</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The most used field for Fibonacci retracements is technical analysis
            of financial markets. Or we can say graphs, because Fibonacci
            appears in patterns that seem random â€” or even those seem a cause of
            something.
          </p>

          <p>Let's take a look at World Birth Rate (2005-2023):</p>

          <img
            src={wbrfar}
            style={{
              margin: "0.618em",
              marginBottom: "1.618em",
              maxWidth: "100%",
              maxHeight: "440px",
              mixBlendMode: "multiply",
            }}
          />

          <p>Let's put the Fibonacci retracements:</p>

          <img
            src={wbrzoom}
            style={{
              margin: "0.618em",
              marginBottom: "1.618em",
              maxWidth: "100%",
              maxHeight: "440px",
              mixBlendMode: "multiply",
            }}
          />

          <p>It's kind of obvious but take a look at it in 2D Area graph:</p>

          <img
            src={wbrarea}
            style={{
              margin: "0.618em",
              marginBottom: "1.618em",
              maxWidth: "100%",
              maxHeight: "440px",
              mixBlendMode: "multiply",
            }}
          />

          <p>
            As you can see, the changes in the population in years fits on
            Fibonacci retracements almost perfectly.
          </p>
          <p>
            As it seems, Fibonacci shows up in a data that varies by the current
            situation like World Birth Rate.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is why you can take Fibonacci as a path. It appears in
            everywhere in every situation and fits almost perfect.
